        <h2>Git</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I ran into a problem where i could not change branchs 
                  without a commit. Through this I found the command 
                  <u>git stash</u> which allows changes to be 
                  saved but not commited. 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Through the last bullet point, I learned that by add a ul within a ul, you can creat sub bullet points</li>
            <li>pwd: display my current location/path </li>
            <li>ls: display directores and files in current directory</li>
            <li>cd file-name: the command to move to a directory</li>
            <li>cd ..: back to last directory</li>
            <li>history: displays last nth commands</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Git Workflow steps</h3>
          <p>These are the workflow steps</p>
          <ol>
            <li>git pull origin main: Before we do anything lets first pull the main branch code to assure we are up to date
              <ul><li>it could be useful to run a <u>git status</u> to see what branch we are in as well</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>git chechout -b feature/name: This creates a feature branch that we name
              <ul><li>Make certain that branch names are relevent</li></ul>
              <ul><li>git status is not a bad idea either</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Make changes to code</li>
            <li>git add -A: We stage our changes to be commited
              <ul><li>Note: this above command stages ALL the changes </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>git commit -m "desciption of the changes we jut made" This update the feature branch locally aka a commit
              <ul><li>We should commit as often as possible</li></ul>
              <ul><li>QUESTION: is it necassary to commit right after staging?</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>git pull origin main: lets make sure we are up to date again</li>
            <li>git push origin feature/name: We push our code to the repo feature branch </li>
            <li>We pull the request on GitHub
              <ul><li>Make sure we are pulling from the feature branch to the main branch</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Code will be reviewed</li>
            <li>Merge pull request on GitHub
              <ul><li>git checkout main</li></ul>
              <ul><li>git pull origin main</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Delete feature branch
              <ul><li>I actually don't know how to do this</li></ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>Will have to back through here to correct typos lol. Just another way to practice the workflow I guess, futhermore, some of the steps may need altering</p>
