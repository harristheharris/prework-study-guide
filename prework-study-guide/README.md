## Description

The goal of this project was to compile my often messy notes onto on page. By doing this, I no longer need to refer to my messy handwriting and instead, have a semi decent website to refer to. Throughout the process, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and, the terminal.

## Installation

## Usage

A very useful tool I added to this project was the GitHub workflow. This is useful as i can now refer to it, but it also futher imprinted those steps onto me typing out the steps.
